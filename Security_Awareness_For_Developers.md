## 🎯 Slide 2: Introduction to Security Awareness

### What is Security Awareness?

Security awareness is the knowledge and attitude that members of an organization possess regarding the protection of physical and information assets.

### For Developers, This Means:
- 🛡️ Understanding security risks in code
- 🔍 Recognizing vulnerabilities early
- 💡 Writing secure code by default
- 🤝 Collaborating with security teams
- 📚 Continuous learning about new threats

### The Developer's Role:
**"Security is not just the security team's job - it's everyone's responsibility!"**

- 💰 Average cost of a data breach: **$4.45 million USD**
- ⏰ Average time to identify a breach: **277 days**
- 📈 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses
- 🔓 95% of breaches are caused by human error

### Impact on Your Organization:
- Financial losses
- Reputation damage
- Legal consequences

## 🔝 Slide 5: The OWASP Top 10 (2021)

### Must-Know Vulnerabilities:

1. **Broken Access Control** - Users accessing unauthorized resources
2. **Cryptographic Failures** - Weak encryption or exposed sensitive data
3. **Injection** - SQL, NoSQL, OS command injection
4. **Insecure Design** - Fundamental design flaws
5. **Security Misconfiguration** - Incorrect security settings
6. **Vulnerable Components** - Using outdated libraries
7. **Authentication Failures** - Weak authentication mechanisms
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Insecure CI/CD pipelines
9. **Security Logging Failures** - Inadequate logging and monitoring
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** - Forcing server to make unauthorized requests

## ⚡ Slide 6: Secure Coding Principles

### The Foundation of Secure Development:

1. **Least Privilege** - Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security
3. **Fail Securely** - Default to secure state on errors
4. **Keep Security Simple** - Complexity increases risk
5. **Don't Trust User Input** - Validate everything
6. **Use Proven Security Components** - Don't reinvent the wheel
7. **Assume Breach Mentality** - Plan for compromise
8. **Separation of Duties** - Divide critical operations

### Remember:
> **"Security should be built in, not bolted on!"**

---

## ✅ Slide 7: Input Validation & Sanitization

### Never Trust User Input!

### ❌ Insecure Code Example (SQL Injection):
```python
# DON'T DO THIS!
username = request.get('username')
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"
db.execute(query)
# Attacker input: ' OR '1'='1
```

### ✅ Secure Code Example:
```python
# DO THIS!
username = request.get('username')
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
db.execute(query, (username,))  # Parameterized query
```

### Best Practices:
- ✅ Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
- ✅ Validate input on server-side (not just client-side)
- ✅ Use allowlists (whitelist) over blocklists
- ✅ Encode output properly
- ✅ Sanitize data for context (HTML, SQL, OS commands)

---

## 🔐 Slide 8: Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication: "Who are you?"
### Authorization: "What can you do?"

### Authentication Best Practices:
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Storing passwords in plain text
const user = {
  username: 'john',
  password: 'password123'  // NEVER!
}

// ✅ GOOD: Hash passwords with salt
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 10;
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
```

### Key Principles:
- 🔑 Use strong password policies (length, complexity)
- 🔐 Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- 🎫 Use secure session management
- ⏱️ Implement session timeout
- 🔄 Use industry-standard protocols (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect)
- 🚫 Never store passwords in plain text
- 🧂 Always hash and salt passwords

---

## 🔑 Slide 9: Managing Secrets & Sensitive Data

### What Are Secrets?
- API keys
- Database credentials
- Private keys
- Tokens
- Certificates

### ❌ Common Mistakes:
```javascript
// NEVER commit this to version control!
const config = {
  apiKey: 'sk_live_123456789abcdef',
  dbPassword: 'MyP@ssw0rd123',
  awsSecret: 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
}
```

### ✅ Best Practices:
- Use environment variables
- Use secret management tools (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Scan repositories for exposed secrets
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Use environment variables
const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  dbPassword: process.env.DB_PASSWORD
}
```

## 📦 Slide 10: Dependency Security

### The Supply Chain Risk

**Did you know?** The average application has:
- 200+ dependencies
- 80% of code comes from third-party libraries

### Common Risks:
- 🐛 Known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- 🦠 Malicious packages
- 🔓 Unmaintained libraries
- ⚠️ License compliance issues

### Best Practices:
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit
pip check
bundle audit

# Update dependencies
npm update
pip install --upgrade
```

### Tools to Use:
- **Dependabot** (GitHub)
- **Snyk**
- **OWASP Dependency-Check**
- **npm audit / pip-audit**

### Action Items:
✅ Regularly update dependencies  
✅ Review security advisories  
✅ Use lock files (package-lock.json, Pipfile.lock)  
✅ Minimize dependencies  

---

## 🧪 Slide 11: Security Testing Basics

### Types of Security Testing:

1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
   - Analyze source code without executing it
   - Tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Semgrep

2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
   - Test running applications
   - Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite

3. **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
   - Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Tools: Snyk, WhiteSource

4. **Penetration Testing**
   - Simulated attacks by security professionals

### Integration into Development:
```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions security workflow
name: Security Scan
on: [push]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run security scan
        run: npm audit
      - name: SAST scan
        run: semgrep --config=auto
```

## 🚨 Slide 12: Common Vulnerabilities & Prevention

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Risk:** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages

❌ **Insecure:**
```javascript
// Directly inserting user input
element.innerHTML = userInput;
```

✅ **Secure:**
```javascript
// Escape user input
element.textContent = userInput;
// Or use sanitization library
const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Risk:** Unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated user

✅ **Prevention:**
- Use CSRF tokens
- Verify origin headers
- Require re-authentication for sensitive actions

### 3. Insecure Deserialization
**Risk:** Executing arbitrary code through manipulated serialized objects

✅ **Prevention:**
- Validate serialized data
- Use JSON instead of language-specific serialization
- Implement integrity checks

   - Use frameworks like STRIDE

3. **Stay Updated**
   - Follow security blogs and advisories
   - Attend security conferences/webinars

4. **Practice Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)**
   - Security at every phase (design, development, testing, deployment)

5. **Learn from Incidents**
   - Study real-world breaches
   - Understand root causes
